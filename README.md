# Twig for Nova

This extension for Nova, [a text editor from Panic](https://nova.app/), adds syntax highlighting for Twig, [a popular templating language](https://twig.symfony.com/). It supports all relevant language features from Twig 3.0+ and even some custom tags/filters from [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) 3.0+.

This extension also includes a huge list of completions for Twig and Craft CMS 3.0+, including Element Queries.

## Installation

In Nova, go to “Extension > Extensions Library”, search for “Twig” and install the extension.

Manual way: Download this repository, extract the .zip file and open the folder with Nova.

If you use Twig inside Markdown files (e.g. Grav CMS): Map “.md” to “Twig-Markdown” in settings to activate syntax highlighting for Twig inside regular Markdown files.

## Development

Clone this repository and open the folder with Nova. In Nova, go to “Settings > General” and enable “Show extension development items in the Extension menu”. Then activate the extension via the “Extension” menu.

## What’s next?

I’d like to add more features to this extension in the future:

- [ ] Add support for matching Twig brackets (not possible at the moment?)

If you have some tips or want to help with development, feel free to let me know!
